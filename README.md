# Upscaling
Super resolution and upscaling pictures
use ComfyUI with the Flux model to change clothing in an image, I start by setting up a node-based workflow that allows me to feed a reference image into Flux’s garment transfer system. I choose a source image with the person whose outfit I want to change, and pair it with either a target image or a detailed text prompt describing the new clothing style. In ComfyUI, I connect nodes like FluxModelLoader, ImagePreprocessor, and GarmentMapper, and link them to a TextPrompt or another visual reference. Once the pipeline is built, I generate the output and fine-tune it by adjusting texture realism, fit accuracy, and lighting to make sure the new clothes blend seamlessly with the original image. It’s a hands-on, creative way for me to design virtual outfit changes with precision and flair.
